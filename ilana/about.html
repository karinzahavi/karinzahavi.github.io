				<p>Born in 1924 in Sarajevo, former Yugoslavia, Ilana Shafir was a high school student when the Nazis invaded. When it became too dangerous to stay in Sarajevo, her family fled and settled in Kula, a small village in southern Yugoslavia. In Kula, Ilana painted landscapes and portraits of children, which she traded in exchange for food to support her family.</p>

				<p>After the war, Ilana enrolled at the Zagreb Art Academy, a prestigious institution that trained its students in all the classical art techniques including large-scale monumental art forms such as fresco, tempera, casein, and sgraffito. Ironically, mosaic was not included in the curriculum and Ilana never had formal training in the art of mosaic. Her introduction to the technique came much later in her artistic career and was rather accidental.<p>

				<p>Upon her graduation in 1949, Ilana immigrated to Israel where she met other newcomers from all over the globe. Fascinated with the diversity and multitude of Jewish ethnic communities in Israel, she began painting portraits of immigrants, especially from the Middle Eastern Diaspora. These portraits reflect the deep sadness and loss she felt as a holocaust survivor.</p>

				<p>In the early sixties, Ilana's need to depict sad Jewish faces subsided and she was finally ready to move on. Searching for a new direction, Ilana found inspiration in nature. She painted fantastic landscapes with imaginative flora and fauna, reflecting an ideal, paradise-like world in which love, harmony, and beauty were restored. The watercolor paintings she made during the next three decades reflect her awe of the abundant beauty and diversity in nature.</p>

				<p>In the late sixties, Ilana came across a handbook describing various mosaic techniques. Over the years, she developed her own method of working, which she calls Spontaneous Mosaic. In a recent interview, Ilana was asked: "How did you get started working in mosaic?  What brought you to the medium and kept you engaged?" Her response was, "I always wanted to make mosaics. The technique has always intrigued me, I do not know why. But from the moment I made my first mosaic, I never stopped, and the last 15 years of my life have been entirely dedicated to this medium."</p>

				<p>lana Shafir's artwork has been exhibited internationally and has been featured in many books and publications. Her life-long career as an artist and educator is marked with many accomplishments. Ilana Shafir is a founding Board member of the International Association of Contemporary Mosaic artists (AIMC) and a member of the Society of American Mosaic Artists, known as SAMA. At the age of eighty-five, Ilana still travels to the USA annually to attend conferences, often as a guest speaker. Ilana is also the recipient of numerous awards. Her mosaic "Gate of The Souls" received the Curator's Choice Award at the inaugural exhibition of SAMA in 2002, her mosaic "In the Deep", was named the Best Large Scale Contemporary Work at the SAMA 2005 exhibition, at the Eleven Eleven Gallery in Washington DC, and her mosaic Temples was selected as Best in Show, at SAMA's 2009 exhibition at the Smith Museum of Art at Navy Pier, Chicago.</p>

				<p>Ilana's most recent project is building a mosaic garden which displays her mosaics in a permanent outdoors exhibition. The garden, adjacent to her home in Ashkelon, Israel, has become an unofficial museum that is frequented by hundreds of visitors annually. Ilana has been cultivating this garden passionately. She works in her studio daily and adds new mosaics to the garden's collection as soon as they are completed.</p>

				<p>In Ashkelon, where Ilana lived since 1951, she is known as the founding director of the Ashkelon Art Center, a flourishing art institute that provided studio classes in various art mediums to thousands of school children and local residents. She was named Honored Citizen of Ashkelon, a prestigious award bestowed upon her in recognition of her contributions to her community.</p>
