	<h2>Designing with data in New York City</h2>
	<p> Hello! I'm Karin, and I do UX research & design testing for an ad tech company in SoHo. Last year, I took the User Experience Design course at General Assembly. I'm very excited to build on that class and learn front-end code. Outside of work, I enjoy cooking, baking & running in Prospect Park.</p>
